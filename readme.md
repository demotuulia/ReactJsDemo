# Introduction

This my demo front end application, which I have made by ReactJS.

With this app you can manage users, by sorting, adding, editing and deleting them.
There is no API, so no changes are saved on the server. This app uses the browser cookies to
save the updates of a user.

# Code

This application is made with ReactJs, Javascript, HTML and CSS.
The file structure follows the standard  ReactJs structure.
My addition is the folder 'lib' where I have put some Javascript classes.

# Demo

This application can be seen live on
